The project consists of five main tabs that offer distinct functionalities. The "BizMatch" tab serves as an Investor-Founder Matching App, facilitating connections between investors and startup founders. It allows investors to create profiles, specifying their funding amounts, interests, and contact information. Startup founders can then input their industry and find matching investors based on shared interests. This tab streamlines the process of finding potential partners and fosters collaborations.

The "BizBot" tab introduces an AI-powered Business Assistant named BizBot. Users can interact with BizBot by inputting questions or requests related to startup incubators, business strategies, or any other relevant topics. BizBot generates helpful responses using advanced language models, providing valuable guidance and insights.

The "Idea Oasis" tab features a Business Idea Generator, which assists users in generating innovative business ideas. By leveraging creative algorithms and user inputs, this tool encourages entrepreneurial thinking and supports individuals in exploring new ventures and opportunities.

The "EnvisionX" tab offers a Stock Market Predictions Tool. Users can enter a stock symbol, and the tool retrieves historical stock data. It then utilizes machine learning techniques, specifically Linear Regression, to predict future stock prices. This feature helps users make informed investment decisions by analyzing stock performance trends and providing predictions.
